    <h2>Dublin City Schools offically blocked https://glitch.me</h2>
    <br />
    <h3 class="section">Whats Happening?</h3>
    <p>
      The School district of dublin has blocked a major coding site that many people use to test and run code from learning to school projects it shouldn't matter. The school blocked it beacuse of someone creating a gaming site which spread throughout the district.
    </p><br />
        <h3 class="section">Alternatives?</h3>
    <p>
Although glitch.me is blocked that doesn't mean the code editor (glitch.com) is blocked. So we suggest that you get a domain from https://codotvu.co/ for FREE and then link it to your glitch project so you can code while the project is served on a diffrent domain.
